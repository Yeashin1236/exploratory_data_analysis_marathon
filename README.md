Project Overview
Notebook: exploratory_data_analysis_marathon.ipynb

Goal: Understand and analyze ultra-marathon running data.
# Methods Used:
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Data Visualization (Seaborn)
- Exploratory Insights Generation

# Key Features
- Removal of irrelevant columns and missing data
- Creation of new features like race season based on month
- Filtering based on event types, location, and year
- Identification of performance patterns in different event lengths (e.g., 50km, 50mi)

# Dataset
